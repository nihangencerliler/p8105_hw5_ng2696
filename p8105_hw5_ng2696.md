## Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))

replace_missing = function(original_values) {
  if (is.numeric(original_values))
   {new_values=replace_na(original_values, mean(original_values,na.rm = TRUE))}
  else 
  {new_values=replace_na(original_values, "virginica")}
  new_values
}

iris_without_missing = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, replace_missing)

head(iris_without_missing)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 5

    ## 2          4.9         3            1.4        0.2  setosa 
    ## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3        0.2  setosa 
    ## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5        1.19 setosa 
    ## 5          5           3.6          1.4        0.2  setosa 
    ## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7        0.4  setosa

For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the mean
of non-missing values For character variables, you should fill in
missing values with “virginica”

## Problem 2

This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and
arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

subject ID arm observations time Start with a dataframe containing all
file names; the list.files function will help Iterate over file names
and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result
as a new variable in the dataframe Tidy the result; manipulate file
names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly
observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary Make
a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and
comment on differences between group

``` r
files_vec=list.files(path = "./data", full.names = TRUE) 
df= data_frame(filename=files_vec, subject_ID=str_sub(files_vec,-6,-5), arm=str_sub(files_vec,-10,-8))
read_and_label=function(files) {filename=files
file_contents=read.csv(files)}
files_vec %>%
  map(read_and_label) 
```
